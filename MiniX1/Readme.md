## 1. What have you produced?
I have produced a face made by two squares each with an ellipse in the center. These squares are supposed to illustrate eyes. I made an ellipse as a nose, and then a rectangle as a mouth. The figures were supposed to illustrate some sort of robotic face. I've used the function "mouseWheel" two make the figures move, when scrolling on a mouse or a touchpad. I made the iris white and the rest of the figure blue, but when the moused/touchpad is pressed the color of all figures will turn orange as the background. What I initially wanted to do was to make the "mouth"/rectangle move faster than the nose, so that is would look like a face upside down when rolling down. Unfortunately I didn't have the time to figure that out. I found the mouseWheel function, and I just added more variables and figures. I found out what made the figures move, and then I just played with it. I added the mouseIsPressed just to make it a little more interactive. I think I found that in references as well.

## 2. How would you describe your first independent coding experience (in relation to thinking, reading, copying, modifying, writing code, and so on)?
I would say, that I was gripped by excitement by the first second I started to play around with P5.js. It is a wonderful tool/javascript library. Not just the library is awesome, but the whole webpage is so well developed and well thought out! I'm very impressed. I had informatics in my first year of gymnasium, and it was horrible! We had a teacher who was an unsuccessful coder, and he kind of tried to make up for being a failure by showing us very difficult coding, and then making us do the same. It was so BORING and horrible.

Although my first experience with coding was very disappointing, there are still some coding logistics that has stuck with me, and that's really nice, because I don't feel like a totally rookie.

## 3. How is the coding process different from, or similar to, reading and writing text?

I really like to write actually, and especially to use a great amount of imagery to make the language in the story more exciting, powerful and colorful. For me, there is nothing like a story that can draw a very rich image in your head. It can be a very powerful tool. What I experience with coding is that, like you can write a very boring and gray story, you can also write in this way in code with a lack of color/something interesting. Therefore I'm so thrilled about this course, because we get to use a tool that allows you to express yourself, using P5.js as a vessel of creativity and expression. I think it's amazing.

Language is language, coding or "regular", but I find coding much more powerful as a language. It has much more potential. I feel like there are no limits with coding, only the ones that you set for yourself. If you really desire to express yourself in a way, you just need to figure out how to do it, but it isn't limited. I think "regular" language has complication with this because there are so many social constructions around "regular" languages like discourses etc. This is something that we fortunately can avoid with coding languages (as far as I know).

## 4. What does code and programming mean to you, and how does the assigned reading help you to further reflect on these terms?

Before, coding didn't really mean anything to me. Now I'm starting to develop some knowledge and thoughts about the subject.

## 1. What have you produced?
I have produced two squares each with an ellipse in the center. These squares are supposed to illustrate eyes. I made an ellipse as a nose, and then a rectangel as a mouth. The figures were supposed to illustrate some sort of robotic face. I've used the function "mouseWheel" two make the figures move, when scrolling on a mouse or a touchpad. I made the iris white and the rest of the figure blue, but when the moused/touchpad is pressed the color of all figures will turn orange as the background. What I initially wanted to do was to make the "mouth"/rectangel move faster than the nose, so that is would look like a face upside down when rolling down. Unfortunately I didn't have the time to figure that out. 

## 2. How would you describe your first independent coding experience (in relation to thinking, reading, copying, modifying, writing code, and so on)?
I would say, that I was gribbed by excitement by the first second I started to play around with P5.js. It is a wonderfull tool/javascript library. Not just the library is awesome, but the whole webpage is so well developed and well thought out! I'm very impressed. I had informatics in my first year of gymnasium, and it was horrible! We had a teacher who was an unsuccesfull coder, and he kind of tried to make up for being a failure by showing us very difficult coding, and then making us do the same. It was so BORING and horrible.

Although my first experince with coding was very disappointing 

## 3. How is the coding process different from, or similar to, reading and writing text?

## 4. What does code and programming mean to you, and how does the assigned reading help you to further reflect on these terms?

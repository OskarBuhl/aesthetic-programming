## What do you want to explore and/or express?
With this MiniX I wanted to have a different approach by writing the readme first while coming up with the concept of this miniX. My initial thought was to create a background made of different loading screens from the most famous and used computer systems (Apple, Windows), and then making the famous throbber, that would count the percent of development until 99% and then just freeze there. Simultaneously the throbber from the Mac computers appear and just keep scrolling. Maybe some text would appear, something like: "you're not wasting your life/time, wait just a minute more". This would be comment on, how we use so much of our time by waiting for some digital clue of response, that would tell us what to do next, like we can't think for ourselves.



## What are the time-related syntaxes/functions that you have used in your program, and why have you used them in this way? How is time being constructed in computation (refer to both the reading materials and your coding)?


## Think about a throbber that you have encounted in digital culture, e.g. for streaming video on YouTube or loading the latest feeds on Facebook, or waiting for a payment transaction, and consider what a throbber communicates, and/or hides? How might we characterize this icon differently?
